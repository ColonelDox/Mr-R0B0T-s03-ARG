Preface
-------

WOOO BOY was there ALOT in this episode that could be ARG related, and I mean alot. The first 10 minutes had an incredible amount of information in it. I've done my best to record as much relevant information as possible. Once I've finished this write up I will check in with the ARGSociety and see what I may have missed. 

This write up take a bit of a different turn than the first episode, which will be backported when I have some time. 
Firstly we'll start with the observations and follow that with screencaps from the episode to back them up. In addition, timestamps are included in case anyone wants to look them up in the episode, bear in mind the time for each viewer may be slightly different. 
You can also find all the screencaps (if needed) in the images folders. Special thanks to ColonelDox for their input, extra info  and double checking.

Preliminary Stuff from previous episodes
----------------------------------------
- 17 of 71 Facilities "This is where the paper records are going"
- Blueprints of the 'Evil' corp facility

- Elliot connects to (the femtocell) via **l4713116.e-corp.usa**


Episode 2 Observations
----------------------

-(01:22) E-corp are setting up/have various other companies such as in the previous episode we saw e-corp estates, in this episode we see e-corp insurance
-(01:30) "Your Trash For 2 E-coin" 
-(01:40) E-corp building number is 901
-(01:45) We first see Elliots ID card and the QR code on it - we will see this card 4 times in the next sequence however one of those times the card is face up (3rd time) and all the others it is upside down
-(02:36) **https://www.trunkclub.com** - looks like a legit website, need to double check if it's part of the ARG or not
-(xx:xx) Poster advert for "FALLERE" on the tube
-(03:04) We see Elliot entering his e-corp password, it looks like it at least has the letters N and Y in it. It may be possible to do some statistical analysis on what looks like are the keys entered. However we see Elliots asterixed password several times this episode, and by the final time it looks like his password is 23 characters long, statistical analysis may not help unless we can observe a very large majority of it. In addition, it could be a common phrase, or something related to the show (e.g. fiveNinehacksoleet1337ynot?. Jury is currently out on this one. 
-(xx:xx) **l223u** -Elliot's desktop reveals a list of files, on the left hand side there is a network drive mapped with a username l223u
-(03:14) **Full Ecorp address** revealed as "901 E 57th Street, New York New York, 10022, Phone number (212)-555-0171 
-(03:17) "Primo poon" is on the 31st Floor - this can be linked to the Reddit posts found on 'inside_e_corp' subreddit, and we should be able to directly attribute the on-screen character to the username that posted a similar comment. 
-(03:23) Map of E-corp Active US Storage Facilities - links to map theory/Geological stuff being a big impact in this seasons ARG.
-(03:56) E-corp Employee Heirarchy (at least for Elliots Department) 
-(04:18) **William Braddock details**: **william.braddock@e-corp-usa.com | aboynamedg00 | https://webmail.e-corp-usa.com/OWA ** 
-(04:18) Tool "credential harvester" used to collect Braddock's details. I believe this is from SET (social engineers toolkit) which has been used previousl by Darlene and her munchkins in season 2. In case you're wondering where it is, run SET then choose options 1 (Social engineering attacks), 2 (Webiste attack Vectors), 3 (Credential Harvester Attack Method) - DISCLAIMER, I am not advocating the use of this software for anything other than legal ethical hacking, red-teaming, or personal education. 
-(04:21) List of William Braddocks inbox - For full names and email address please refer to subfolder
-(04:21) **HI COLIN** Ticketmaster email to William Braddock about his 'Goo Goo Dolls' tickets - so looks like either a) he uses a different login for ticketmaster OR b) someone else forwarded him on the tickets. 
-(04:21) One of the emails states that there will be 'Server Maintenance' next week
-(04:31) The picture behind Braddocks desk looks pretty odd, could possibly be some sort of <> cipher? 
-(04:33) The woman with the FBI from e-corp looks to be **Robyn/Bobby Fulltern** Not sure if her QR code can enhanced like Elliots. 
-(04:55) **e-corp-ua.com/cpl directory/shipping/108898** website for the e-corp logistics
-(xx:xx) EARL the driver states that he has come to "SU FALLS" (??) South Dakota
-(05:58) **PETER MCCLEEREY password **tapitback!** 
-(06:38) **ts1.e-corp-usa.com** looks like a production server for uploading new software to e-corp hardware
-(06:56) Assembly code for unit **apc_hw05** - personally I don't believe there's enough of this code to compile - there's a chance the hex on the right hand side has something hidden in it. I'll keep my ear to the ground but at the moment there's so many other things to investigate that I won't be trying to decode a bunch of stuff that looks legitimate. 
-(xx:xx) **K6F7241 - FTPplugin**
-(xx:xx) **$73 million** the amount of money E-corp looks to save if they followed Elliot's recovery plan. Is that 73 million in this new age of the dollar becoming worthless? cos that probably wouldn't even buy 5 apples in 6 months time. ;)
-(07:15) Elliots QR code/Id Badge upright
-(xx:xx) "Apples 3 for $25 or 5 e-coin"
-(07:57) Elliots Password looks to be 21 characters long
-(08:01) Elliots Password looks to be 23 characters long
-(xx:xx) **r/Inside_Evil_Corp** subreddit, howwever it's apparent that it's only through Elliot's eyes does the 'e' in 'e-corp' turn to 'evil' 
-(xx:xx) **217 Broadway, tel - 212-673-7260** Chinese restaurant address next to Elliot's apartment - This has probably been noticed several times before, the phone number doesn't have the classic "555" in the middle, so this could be a legit phone number/actual building. 
-(xx:xx) **207 Broadway** Elliot's address, for completeness his apartment number is 4E. 
-(09:48) Continuity easter egg? Is Elliot Crying in the exact same place that he was in season 1 episode 1 ?
-(10:04) Elliot gets his prescription from "Essex Street Pharmacy"
 

TODO
====
- Fix some timestamps
- Investigate 'trunkclub.com'
- link "primo poon" guy to reddit post
- I have heard of someone successfully sharpening Elliots QR code to get another ARG site out of it, I would like to try this myself but I dont think I have the necessary image skills - so need to track down the sharpened image, and give credit to the originator. 
- EMAIL ALL THE THINGS, all of the e-corp heirarchy and all the people seen in William Braddocks and co's emails. 
- Create emails folder for list of all employees and email addresses
- Try to find out why William Braddock is called COLIN by ticketmaster
- Confirm FULLTERN's first name, and find out if QR code can be enhanced
- Get proper name of where the warehouse is that EARL has delivered stuff to. (Su Falls) ???
- Find Screenshot for K6F7241 evidence
