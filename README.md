# Mr-R0B0T-s03-ARG
A writeup for things found and theories regarding the Mr Robot Season 3 ARG

This is a living document and will seek to layout observations and investigations made into the Season 3 ARG. This is not a description of the story, nor how the story and ARG may interact. 

Layout
------

**Episodes** folder contains what will mostly be the s0urce information. 
Inside Each episode will be a list of findings, theories, links found, pictures, QR codes, etc, basically everything that COULD be ARG related. The readme for each one will list what has been found, investigated, results, and conclusions. 

**Sites** folder contains sites and links found from Episode / Other investigation
Each ARG Site will have it's own subdirectory, along with a readme to include the conclusions, and theories, backup scripts and tools as necessary, and notes as just a personal account of some things that may be out of the ordinary.
