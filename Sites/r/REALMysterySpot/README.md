##  It’s All A Simulation (self.REALMysterySpot) submitted 2 years ago by DenOfMellowMen

Our entire perception of reality is all but a simulation. 
Everything we see and know and touch and feel is an illusion. 
All facets of your life is nothing more than a digital construct in some future civilization’s computer simulation. 
You are basically a more boring (albeit high-res) version of The Sims. 
Or, if you want to get real trippy about it... As our future in this simulation continues along, 
we will have developed the computing power to run our own simulations, thus creating a simulation in a simulation.
And maybe that’s what we are in all along anyway 
-- a simulation of someone who has no idea that they themselves are in a simulation.
And your “mystery spots” can be explained away by a lack of processing power in the computer that is running our simulation 
-- either in the top level sim or the sim within the sim 
-- or perhaps even corrupt bits of code.

“Order of Sorcery” according to Baudrillard.

Ideas:
>
**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation**

Simulacra and Simulation breaks the sign-order into four stages: **Third Stage-> is referenced with the "order of socery" Could this be a reference to Series 3?**

The first stage is a faithful image/copy, where we believe, and it may even be correct, that a sign is a "reflection of a profound reality" (pg 6), this is a good appearance, in what Baudrillard called "the sacramental order".

The second stage is perversion of reality, this is where we come to believe the sign to be an unfaithful copy, which "masks and denatures" reality as an "evil appearance—it is of the order of maleficence". Here, signs and images do not faithfully reveal reality to us, but can hint at the existence of an obscure reality which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.
    
**The third stage masks the absence of a profound reality, where the sign pretends to be a faithful copy, but it is a copy with no original. 
Signs and images claim to represent something real, but no representation is taking place and arbitrary images are merely suggested as things which they have no relationship to. 
Baudrillard calls this the "order of sorcery", a regime of semantic algebra where all human meaning is conjured artificially to appear as a reference to the (increasingly) hermetic truth.**
    
The fourth stage is pure simulacrum, in which the simulacrum has no relationship to any reality whatsoever. Here, signs merely reflect other signs and any claim to reality on the part of images or signs is only of the order of other such claims. This is a regime of total equivalency, where cultural products need no longer even pretend to be real in a naïve sense, because the experiences of consumers' lives are so predominantly artificial that even claims to reality are expected to be phrased in artificial, "hyperreal" terms. Any naïve pretension to reality as such is perceived as bereft of critical self-awareness, and thus as oversentimental.

You mean, you’ll put down your rock and I’ll put down my sword, and we’ll try and kill each other like civilized people? For the ** 264th time ** there's no need to argue, zeesh...where's the love? :x Going incognito now. :E

** 264th seems important **

## Oregon Vortex (self.REALMysterySpot) submitted 2 years ago by redstar_redeye

The tourist destination is actually based off a REAL place in Oregon where the gravitational pull is at an angle. The government built the skewed buildings for what is now the so-called tourist trap because word was already out about the vortex, so the “tourist trap” became cover for the REAL site, which is now under US Gov control. It’s not just some wonky gravity. It’s a portal between other vortexes on earth, teleporting from here to where ever -- all under control of the Military of course!!! The REAL vortex is located where the Boardman Naval Bombing Range sits. Clearly “Perception Management” going on here -- a classic US Military disinformation tactic. One discredits the idea of the vortex with it’s cheesy slanted structures. The military facility dissuades looky-loos from investigating for fear of getting “blown to bits”. The US Gov has been doing tests at vortexes like these for years now but no one will acknowledge that they’re sending troops through the vortex to god knows where!!! And who knows what they’ll unleash.

** Weird looking satalite imagery with square - nothing notable thus far.
Used co ords to get more precise location **
