# Overview of IDEAS: 
* Does this give strength to the alternate universe fan theory?
* Reddit short links do they have any significance, can they be used as anything else.e.g  https://redd.it/74zefi
   meaning 74zefi could be tried in https://www.nyspcjis.net/menu/services/nyspncic2000/ 
* Some of these references to plot lines in movies or shows?
* Subreddit Timeline map (Credit Discord guys) : https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/367880338636144641/369266941577265152/subreddit-map.png

* Map of posts : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LJ5LhYn959zqXR_zi_JJFjduXps&usp=sharing
* Map of locations mentioned in the posts, can the locations given can be found on a map and plotted.

* On the map I have plotted the general state areas (blue) - Generally where google maps takes you when searching.


If more locations come up I can add them to the map, so far this is locations featured in the real mystery thread.
Close up pictures of interesting areas are detailed below. 

# General Area Map
Mapped locations show a polygon/square area, where Shenandoah Caverns in VA seems to be the odd one out.

The yellow placemarkers are areas of interest that are more specific to the areas in the post.
The purple markers are possible areas of interest, being a Hydrogen Collider in NY (havent found one in NJ yet) and also 264th Street.

“Order of Sorcery” according to Baudrillard.

### Ideas:

**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation**

Simulacra and Simulation breaks the sign-order into four stages: **Third Stage-> is referenced with the "order of socery" Could this be a reference to Series 3?**

The first stage is a faithful image/copy, where we believe, and it may even be correct, that a sign is a "reflection of a profound reality" (pg 6), this is a good appearance, in what Baudrillard called "the sacramental order".

The second stage is perversion of reality, this is where we come to believe the sign to be an unfaithful copy, which "masks and denatures" reality as an "evil appearance—it is of the order of maleficence". Here, signs and images do not faithfully reveal reality to us, but can hint at the existence of an obscure reality which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.
    
**The third stage masks the absence of a profound reality, where the sign pretends to be a faithful copy, but it is a copy with no original. 
Signs and images claim to represent something real, but no representation is taking place and arbitrary images are merely suggested as things which they have no relationship to. 
Baudrillard calls this the "order of sorcery", a regime of semantic algebra where all human meaning is conjured artificially to appear as a reference to the (increasingly) hermetic truth.**
    
The fourth stage is pure simulacrum, in which the simulacrum has no relationship to any reality whatsoever. Here, signs merely reflect other signs and any claim to reality on the part of images or signs is only of the order of other such claims. This is a regime of total equivalency, where cultural products need no longer even pretend to be real in a naïve sense, because the experiences of consumers' lives are so predominantly artificial that even claims to reality are expected to be phrased in artificial, "hyperreal" terms. Any naïve pretension to reality as such is perceived as bereft of critical self-awareness, and thus as oversentimental.

## Shenandoah Caverns in VA (self.REALMysterySpot) submitted 2 years ago by LuckySpelunky
Appears to be the odd one out of the polygon of states.
The Yellow Barn is open daily from 9 AM to 5 PM 
https://shenandoahcaverns.com/

* Had a thought that maybe the yellow barn may mean something, with reference to the red wheel barrow. Food outlet with colour mentioned.
I feel the colours Red Organge and YEllow to be very prominenet this season

Boundary Waters --> Google maps Alice Lake and lake Carol

> Went on a camping expedition in the Boundary Waters, departed from Ely, MN... after a few days of canoeing and portaging off the beaten path, found a spot where my compass wigged out. 
> Dial was all over the place. Magnetic field had to have been off right in that spot. Even my GPS was off. 
> Quickly moved along and everything went back to normal. It was in the open water so I couldn’t find it again even if I wanted to. But it was a bizarre experience.

## Oregon Vortex (self.REALMysterySpot) submitted 2 years ago by redstar_redeye
url:https://www.reddit.com/r/REALMysterySpot/comments/74z9n9/oregon_vortex/ shortlink:https://redd.it/74z9n9

>The tourist destination is actually based off a REAL place in Oregon where the gravitational pull is at an angle. The government built the skewed buildings for what is now the so-called tourist trap because word was already out about the vortex, so the “tourist trap” became cover for the REAL site, which is now under US Gov control. It’s not just some wonky gravity. 
> It’s a portal between other vortexes on earth, teleporting from here to where ever -- all under control of the Military of course!!! The REAL vortex is located where the Boardman Naval Bombing Range sits. Clearly “Perception Management” going on here -- a classic US Military disinformation tactic. One discredits the idea of the vortex with it’s cheesy slanted structures. 
> The military facility dissuades looky-loos from investigating for fear of getting “blown to bits”. The US Gov has been doing tests at vortexes like these for years now but no one will acknowledge that they’re sending troops through the vortex to god knows where!!! And who knows what they’ll unleash.

*Weird looking satalite imagery with square - nothing notable thus far.
Used co ords to get more precise location *
