Information
-----------

The site is a bit pf a puzzle. It shows a custom "404" page (more info below)

![rux_404](https://github.com/z3r07h/Mr-R0B0T-s03-ARG/tree/master/Sites/ruxmsu9u.net/ruxmsu9u.net.jpg)

When inspecting the source code there is a function that lets users speed up the color pattern by holding down the space bar. 

keyCode == 32  (keyCode 32 is spacebar in javascript)


Theories
--------

ColonelDox has dome some work on the colors that cycle and I'll need to update this with the results.
