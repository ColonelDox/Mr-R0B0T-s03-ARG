Information
-----------

This is the shipping web-app that Elliot uses to redirect E-corp backups to a facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

The source has a bunch of javascript in it, but this looks to be for "new relic" which is a piece of analytics software, similar to kibana if you've heard of that. I'm not sure why at this point NBC would want heavy amount of logging done on this page/site, but maybe we'll find out.
