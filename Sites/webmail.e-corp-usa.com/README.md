First seen in ep3.1_undo.gz when William Braddock gets hacked

RESULTS
=======

William Braddock Error Code:\
**#13489-RARECHPOT** 

RARECHPOT is an anagram of Carthorpe (a town in England https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthorpe) & phartcore (means nothing)\

Peter Mccleery Error Code:\
**#123578-PARMLETOR**

PARMLETOR is an anagram of Palmer Ort ( a place in the Baltic sea https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Ort) & premortal (means nothing) 

The numbers also seem important somehow, but can't link them to anything yet. 
perhaps it's pinning a location to a certain number base. Also what if the color by numbers and geographical locations combine? maybe we should colours in certain parts of maps with the colors.. hmmm tenuous.

Base64'd the error Letters, but only jibberish came out 

TODO
====

Maybe try and use Burp suite to see if error codes can be emnumerated. 
Change error codes to H2 / Bigger Font
Investigate more
